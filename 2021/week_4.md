- **NOTAM**
  - NOTAM stands for "Notices to airmen", the concept is for pilots to know about temporary changes to flying conditions that could affect their job. The author proposes having a single document or resource that communicates temporary conditions or changes that are important for an engineer to know about. 
  - Although there would be some habit-building with keeping this information up to date, I think this could be a potentially useful document for pointing out the set of temporarily unusual conditions of your software systems.
