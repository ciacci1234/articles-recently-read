- **Cloudflare's Simulation Service: Soar**
  - High-level overview of a service Cloudflare has recently rolled out for testing the entirety of their systems with simulations. Soar allows CF engineers to more easily set up simulations of the proposed changes to the system they are making, and also allows CF to simulation test customer-specific configurations and potential problems with those configs. Lots of network-y and infrastructure-y stuff I didn't understand, but still a good read on how a company handles testing a complex set of product offerings.

- **Slack RCA for Jan.4 issues**
  - Issues with 'routing problem between network boundaries on the network of our cloud providers' caused downtime for Slack's back-end servers, which in turn exacerbated the load their provisioning service was equipped to handle, and new servers were unable to spin up. The network issues also knocked out their observability platform.
  - I felt this RCA was a little too light in detail in terms of what issues Slack's cloud provider encountered and how it impacted their observability platform. I also would've liked to see more details on how the incident was imagined, but I guess RCA's are terse in those kinds of details vs post-mortems
