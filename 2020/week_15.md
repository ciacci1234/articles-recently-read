- **Github's Process for upgrading to Ruby 2.7**
  - Breezy writeup of how Github handled upgrading to Ruby 2.7
  - A couple benefits they noted to upgrading: 20 sec drop in application bootup time and going from "~780k   allocations to ~668k allocations"

- **Ruby 3 Updates to Positional and Keyword arguments**
  - Had to fully read through it to get a sense of things, but by the end I had a good sense of the significance of the change
  - Also helped me understand positional vs keyword arguments and some implicit behaviors Ruby has. Ruby 2.7 will also point out the changes coming in Ruby 3

- **Garbage Collection in Ruby**
  - One person's notes on GC in Ruby. If I knew more about C and memory management, I think I would've gotten more out of this post, but I still picked up a few meaningful things such as the fact that Ruby's GC is what is known as "stop-the-world" garbage collection (code cannot run while GC is happening), and I think, if I'm recalling the article correctly, this is due to Ruby's single-threaded nature(?). Also fun to read how Ruby Objects are stored as structs within C and also Ruby's Garbage Collector does more than garbage collecting!
